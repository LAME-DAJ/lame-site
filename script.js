  content: `"Grown dummy". Two words that have been replaying in my head today and affecting my energy in a negative way. Even though I know I'm intelligent in many ways,and I've spent the last two days building my first website with the help of chat gpt(not your usual dummy activities),I still cant shake the cringey feeling I get when those two words skate through my mind every couple minutes. why tho?, is the question I ask my self, and myself gonna break it down so I can understand it accept it for what it is and get back to my best energy. "Grown Dummy", fist of all that's a very rare combination to be called, so off the rip it's like damn that's personal lol. it's the grown part fr like if they had said "young dummy", those two words are synonymous, Young and Dumb, you hear it all the time it's kinda accepted,almost expected where there's young there may also be dumb. but to be called a grown dummy says you're too old to be so dumb and that stings because it brings with it a sense of regret or failure, like I've some how missed the age threshold that it is ok to be dumb and I'm now grown and stuck on the dummy train😒🚆🤦🏾‍♀️. like I have no right to be a dummy at my age. So really that insult packed a double punch. Now how do I get over it ? well first I unpack it, do i think I'm a "grown dummy"?, ideally no, can I see why other people would call me a "grown dummy?", honestly yes. So there, a little honesty and acceptance does alot to take some of the cringe away. Yes I'm grown, yes I did and said dumb shit and could bet I'll say and do more more dumb shit before it's all over so if I look at it that way I'll always be a grown very intelligent dummy🤷🏾‍♀️,so it's no use felling embarrassed about it now. then I wonder what exactly caused this reaction. like what was it that I said or did that earned me the label "Grown dummy" because while whether or not I'm grown can be easily measured and agreed upon, whether or not I am, or what I said or did is dumb is subjective(not easily measured and could be argued). Unfortunately I can very quickly think of plenty of reasons why someone would call me a "grown dummy"😄 so I cant really pin point what caused them to come to that conclusion 😄.No matter which example I give the word "dumb" or the state of being a "dummy" in this context is subjective and even my own opinion of the things I say and do is ever changing. while today I may agree my way of thinking and actions in the past were "dumb", at the time I didn't feel that way it may have been the best/smartest POV,Option,solution at the time.so what's dumb today was smart yesterday that's okay it's apart of learning and growing. If I can live to see the errors of the day before then I can always spend the next day correcting them. So yes it hurts to be labeled a "Grown dummy" I'll take it as encouragement to do better. As long as there is a new day I'm fine with being a GROWInG DUmMY. I Love That Energy!`

    content: `I wanna be an open book, have my pages for ever turning and flowing in the wind.I wanna be an open book. I feel people trying read me from the back cover. I cant speak up and say the summary is misleading.  when I open up the tell my side it's like nobody's interested in reading.,
    not but for real I'm not the best at expressing myself verbally I don't know why when it's something deeper than just everyday conversation and more than one person listening I get nervous I hate the sound of my voice, I second guess my choice to speak. so I close my book under lock and key in fear of what a passing reader would think of me.,
    I attach my self to the reviews I hear. "this book seems good" "I heard it's funny" "yeah it's a good read" "I heard the authors a pretty cool person" ect. that's all true lol the problem is all that is on the surface( the cover) yes you'll get all that from with in the pages but, when I open up I read the truth that some say I should have left out. the truth that conflicts with the cover.,
    that truth is not what people would expect from just reading the back my story is different it's not a easy read some parts make me cringe,some parts make proud ,some parts make me happy, sad,good,bad. but no one can ever get the full story if I snatched the bookand run when it getto a certain part.I know the story gets better but I still be stuck on rvery letter from the chapters before. bottom line id love to be an open book ideally that would make feel free,
    but in reality it just puts a target on me. The reviews,people hear my title and think "damn thats a shame" If the story stopped there I would agree but since the shameful parts there has been many more installments of me.,
    this time I'll just keep the book open I read the worst part outloud to a tough crowd the story gets better for who ever wants to turn the page and read the real daj. Im just L.A.M.E loving all my energy.`

  content: `Like i really hate even the idea of being misunderstood it's the on thing that causes me the most anxiety in life. I always thought my self to be a good communicator when it comes to making my point clearly like when I'm in the right energy (confident,assertive,temporarily extroverted) the problem is I'm not always in that energy most times I'm less outgoing and assertive so my point gets lost in the mix. I've once found comfort in saying that when I  think to my self I don't have to work so hard to be clear because I already know the inside and outside of what I'm trying to say. But now I'm face with the question of how do I deal with even my thoughts being taken wrong or misunderstood. How do I deal with the pressure of having to clearly articulate even my inner dialog and carefully plan the words of my most honest conversations out of fear of being mistaken. There is really no way to do that it just come to a point where accept that I cant always and don't have to put thing in a way that everyone understands. The mind should be a safe place to think freely and move through life.the idea that people would go to great lengths to pry into someone else first and most private space to hear their thoughts but won't communicate in real life is something that is hard for me to grasp, and it's only worsening my poor communication habits and anxiety around it because if you can hear how I really feel and things are the way they are than I  feel like the misunderstanding is a choice and it's no point in me trying to explain  my self or ask questions either because if someone knows the questions I have in my head and the have the answers but still don't offer them would me asking make a difference? Maybe it would idk im trying work on verbalizing what's in my mind even tho now I see even less of a point in doing so than ever.The urge to speak keeps getting stronger but then it feels useless. `

  content: `This website is meant to be an extension of my energy but I'm noticing it becoming a reflection of my current emotional state in a way that I didn't full anticipate. It's therapeutic for me right now to just come here and right how I feel when ever I feel, because for the past 6 years especially but really all my life is didn't feel have a way to work through ar express my problems/feelings the reason being for most of my life was probably just me not wanting to cause trouble for other people  and worrying about what people would think of me but for the past 6 years the reason has been me not being able to trust anyone I know or meet. So my method of dealing with thing is and has always been just thinking to myself but writing things out here has helped a little better lately just by helping me  stream line my thoughts.  The energy on this page is not ideal for me or anyone really but it's where I keep ending up lately. Being in high spirits good energy doesn't drive me to post here I kinda just enjoy those moments in real time. I'm still L.A.M.E but I'm just not sharing it all here.`

My only social media outlet youtube has been taken over by what seems to be participants in the whole thing they mock me by creating a spiritual war within religion vs spirituality they purposely let me know that the know what's going on but they play mind games to keep me confused. I'm told to change my perspective, I'm told to go within  to see the truth but I'm just stuck.everyone around is in on it and some will seem sympathetic but none will help or tell me the truth . I'm just confused. I feel like I'm on some type  show like the tryman show or the even Steven's movie or something.at this point I'll just pick a side and play because the middle just don't feel safe. I'm starting to gas light my self into thinking it myself so I'm trying avoid giving anyone else the chance to. Idk i cant trust Random people to be telling me the truth when my own family turned against me it's really crazy but for some reason It's clear they want me to know they turned against me and they want me to think that my family has stolen some type of money or trust from me so I can turn on them and play this game of war.but I don't know nothing about that and I don't want hurt anybody inthe name of some money especially my parents.who are also participants. I know this for sure I just don't know what will come next. I starting to feel like I'm sacrificing my self and my peace for my enemies this shit is starting to get to me all I can say is its weird.i think I should play but high key  I'm scared lol if this is a game it fell like a loose loose situation for me but I don't wanna wonder what if type shit so....ima stop being a bitch lol if I end up somewhere I should be at least I bet on me lol I don't really know what that last line meant it just sounded good😄`

  content: `Nah but fr the worst part is this religion vs spirituality aspect of it because before I  noticed what was going on I was happy just believing that there was a higher force protecting and guiding me i didn't know whether it was "god","jesus","theuniverse",my ancestors, or recently passed relatives. I would just thank them all. Now I'm realizing how all that was used against me to confused me and lead me wrong.and now I'm having a hard time believing in any of those people or concepts. If you stand for nothing you'll fall for anything.  If you don't believe in  any body you'll follow any one . I feel like that what just happened to me. I noticed it while it was happening but the fact that I couldn't trust anyone force me to just reject them all church,religion, spirituality, ancestors everthing.but see the pattern that i always turn to one of them when I need guidance so that s what it really come down to. I just cant trust humans to deliver the message out of fear of being manipulated. Choosing what to believe in is hard enough without mind games. People say just reading the text for my self i just feel like it's not enough time to read it all and compare . What if I get to the end and realize there is no real answer.  Clearly someone has been playing "god" in my life or at least attempting to. They keep saying I'm the chosen one but I  wanna know ,chosen by who?`
